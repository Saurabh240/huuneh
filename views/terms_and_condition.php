        <h1>Terms and conditions for an online Huuneh account</h1>
        <p>1. Introduction</p>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions govern your use of the online courier services provided by Huuneh ("we," "us," or "our"). By creating an online courier account, you (the “client”) agree to comply with these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        
        <p>2. Account Creation</p>
        <p>To use our online courier services, you must create an account. You agree to provide accurate and complete information during the registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. To create a valid account and place a delivery order, the client must be 18 years of age or older and must follow the remaining terms and conditions outlined.</p>
        
        <p>3. Service Availability</p>
        <p>Our online courier services are available for use within the specified regions or countries. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the services at any time without prior notice.</p>
        
        <p>4. Booking Shipments</p>
        <p>You may book shipments through your online courier account. Shipments are subject to availability and our terms of service. You agree to provide accurate shipment details, including sender and recipient information.</p>
        
        <p>5. Payment & Pricing</p>
        <p>Payment for courier services from a “Personal Account” is due at the time of booking “PrePaid Service”. Payment for courier services from a “Business Account” is due either at the time of booking “PrePaid Service”, “Weekly Billing” or “Monthly Billing”. We accept payment through the methods specified on our website. Payment methods include: Credit Cards, Cash, Cheques, and E-Transfer. All payments are final and non-refundable, except as required by law. Huuneh reserves the right to change, update, or modify pricing at any time without any notice required.</p>
        
        <p>6. Shipping Guidelines</p>
        <p>You agree to comply with all shipping guidelines and regulations imposed by us and relevant authorities. Prohibited items include but are not limited to hazardous materials, illegal substances, explosives or weapons, and perishable goods. Huuneh reserves the right to inspect any package we are solicited to deliver if we deem the package may be in opposition to stated terms and conditions. Inspection includes opening packages to verify contents are as the client stated when processing an order.</p>
        
        <p>7. Delivery</p>
        <p>We will make reasonable efforts to deliver shipments according to the specified timelines and service type requested. Delays may occur due to factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, road work & closures, or other circumstances. We are not liable for delivery delays caused by events beyond our reasonable control. If Huuneh is unable to deliver a shipment, Huuneh will contact the client to notify them of the circumstances surrounding the failed delivery attempt. Huuneh will attempt to deliver the package again for a fee if the client is partly responsible for the failed delivery attempt. If the delivery is returned to the sender the client will be charged double the cost of the original price quoted for that single delivery.</p>
        
        <p>8. Tracking</p>
        <p>You may track the status of your delivery through your online courier account. While we strive to provide accurate tracking information, we do not guarantee real-time updates. To ensure the safety and reliability of Huuneh, our clients, and our community drivers, Huuneh will display the name of the assigned driver making the delivery.</p>
        
        <p>9. User Responsibilities</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the content of your shipments and compliance with applicable laws. You agree not to use our online courier services for illegal or fraudulent activities. You are responsible for making sure your order is ready for pickup when the driver arrives, as Huuneh drivers will not wait longer than 10 minutes during pick up times.</p>
